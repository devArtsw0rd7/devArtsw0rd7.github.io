  <h1 id="lord">Lord,</h1>
<p>I know Oswald&rsquo;s words are just the words of a man and not your words, but they seem to be good and convicting:</p>
<p>&ldquo;We talk about prayer as if God hears us regardless of what our relationship is to Him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;There is no praying unless we are living as children of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You are Holy. You are also gracious, and I can approach you &ldquo;just as I am.&rdquo;
The only way I can understand this is in tension- a picture of hands grasped and taught. A dance. So meet me now, Lord, in that tension. I have sinned against you, and the sin I am aware of is great. I&rsquo;m sure my blind spots are huge. I feel foolish to be in this state at the age of 38&hellip; I should be eating solid food, not milk.</p>
<p>Yet here I am.</p>
<p>Forgive me, Lord, for my single-minded focus on myself. Teach me to gaze on you as I misguidedly do myself.</p>
<p>Lord, I do not fully understand the process going on in my daughter&rsquo;s heart and mind, and to be honest, I am terrified on her behalf. I know everyone&rsquo;s journey to and with you is their own, and I should not judge her based on her ability or inability to communicate her thoughts, feelings, and beliefs&hellip; but I struggle. Help me to get out of the way. Holy Spirit, do you work. I pray that you would still her heart, give her the courage to stand and declare that she is yours, and your peace in the midst of fear, anxiety, and discomfort. May the moment of her declaration be evidence of your love for her, your truth and how it interacts with her. I trust you Lord. Woo her and draw her near to you.</p>
<p>In your name,
Amen</p>
