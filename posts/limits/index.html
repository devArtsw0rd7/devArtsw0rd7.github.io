  <h1 id="lord">Lord,</h1>
<p>I was awoken from a dark dream to the smell of Chai tea and whispers&hellip; Aurora and Elanor getting up to pray. After the dream, this was a welcome reality.</p>
<p>I am running up against my limits as regards self-discipline, it seems. My desire to get up early and run, exercise, etc. is utterly gone. I know running later will be more challenging, but I can&rsquo;t make myself do it.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Spiritual confusion can only be conquered through obedience.&rsquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a thought. A thought I&rsquo;ve had before, maybe even read before. Not tried, though, really. No, unfortunately, I am easily blown and tossed around by my own evil and selfish desires.</p>
<p>Lord, this morning I attempt to turn from those desires to you.
Pride
Inadequacy
Lust
Fear</p>
<p>I lay them aside, and ask for your forgiveness. I put myself forward into your presence, like one initially unwillingly volunteered. I bow now, obedient, desirous to explore your depths.</p>
<p>Do you smile? Do you know better? How can you be so loving and be so ancient? You are not like us.</p>
<p>Lord, help me prepare to say the words that need to be heard this week. Give me confidence and purpose. Even now the whispers at the back of my head - &lsquo;you&rsquo;re not good enough&rsquo; - I ignore them and look to you, Jesus.</p>
<p>Lord, help me with my finances, with our spending&hellip; help me to rightly order my life around you.</p>
<p>Thank you for music. It helps.</p>
