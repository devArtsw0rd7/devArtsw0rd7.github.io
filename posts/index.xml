      <description>Lord, I was awoken from a dark dream to the smell of Chai tea and whispers&amp;hellip; Aurora and Elanor getting up to pray. After the dream, this was a welcome reality.
I am running up against my limits as regards self-discipline, it seems. My desire to get up early and run, exercise, etc. is utterly gone. I know running later will be more challenging, but I can&amp;rsquo;t make myself do it.</description>

      <description>Lord, I know Oswald&amp;rsquo;s words are just the words of a man and not your words, but they seem to be good and convicting:
&amp;ldquo;We talk about prayer as if God hears us regardless of what our relationship is to Him.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;There is no praying unless we are living as children of God.&amp;rdquo;
You are Holy. You are also gracious, and I can approach you &amp;ldquo;just as I am.&amp;rdquo; The only way I can understand this is in tension- a picture of hands grasped and taught.</description>
