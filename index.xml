      <description>Lord, I know Oswald&amp;rsquo;s words are just the words of a man and not your words, but they seem to be good and convicting:
&amp;ldquo;We talk about prayer as if God hears us regardless of what our relationship is to Him.&amp;rdquo;
&amp;ldquo;There is no praying unless we are living as children of God.&amp;rdquo;
You are Holy. You are also gracious, and I can approach you &amp;ldquo;just as I am.&amp;rdquo; The only way I can understand this is in tension- a picture of hands grasped and taught.</description>
